# Data Persistence and State Management

Rules for handling data persistence, state management, and run storage.

## State Management Requirements

- **Run State**: Track current Nuzlocke run with all data
- **Multiple Runs**: Support for multiple concurrent runs
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically save run state to prevent data loss
- **Export/Import**: Share run data between users

## Data Storage Strategy

- **Local Storage**: Store run data in browser localStorage
- **IndexedDB**: Use for larger datasets and better performance
- **Export Format**: JSON format for sharing runs
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups of run data

## Run Data Structure

```typescript
interface NuzlockeRun {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  gameMode: 'classic' | 'remix';
  startDate: Date;
  currentLocation: string;
  badges: string[];
  team: TeamMember[];
  deathBox: TeamMember[];
  encounters: EncounterHistory[];
  fusions: FusionHistory[];
  settings: RunSettings;
}
```

## State Management Patterns

- Use React Context for global state
- Implement reducer pattern for complex state changes
- Use custom hooks for state logic
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Add undo/redo functionality for critical actions

## Data Validation

- Validate run data on load
- Check data integrity before saving
- Implement migration for data format changes
- Handle corrupted data gracefully
- Provide data recovery options

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy load large datasets
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- Use web workers for heavy calculations

## Security and Privacy

- Encrypt sensitive run data
- Implement user authentication for cloud storage
- Handle data export/import securely
- Provide data deletion options
- Comply with privacy regulations
