# Quality and Security Guidelines

Rules for ensuring code quality, security, and maintainability.

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch for data operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Test with screen readers

## Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data from external sources
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper CORS policies if needed

## Documentation

- Update README.md with project-specific information
- Document complex algorithms and data structures
- Add inline comments only for complex business logic that cannot be made self-documenting
- Keep API documentation up to date

## Git Workflow

- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Update .gitignore for build artifacts
- Document breaking changes

## Environment Setup

- Use Node.js 17+ for development
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Set up proper environment variables
- Configure IDE for TypeScript and ESLint
