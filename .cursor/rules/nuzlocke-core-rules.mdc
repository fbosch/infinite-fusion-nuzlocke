# Core Nuzlocke Rules
These are the fundamental Nuzlocke rules that must be implemented in the tracker.

## Essential Nuzlocke Rules
1. **First Encounter Rule**: Only catch the first Pokémon encountered in each new area
2. **Fainting = Death**: Pokémon that faint cannot be used again and must be released or boxed
3. **Nickname Rule**: All Pokémon must be nicknamed to create emotional attachment

## Implementation Requirements
- Track which areas have been visited and what was caught
- Prevent multiple catches from the same area
- Mark Pokémon as "dead" when they faint
- Require nicknames for all caught Pokémon
- Maintain a "death box" for fainted Pokémon
- Validate that dead Pokémon cannot be used in battles

## State Management
- Track current team with nicknames, levels, and status
- Maintain encounter history per route/area
- Store fainted Pokémon separately from active team
- Track game progress (current location, gym badges)

## Data Structures Needed
- `NuzlockeRun`: Overall run state
- `TeamMember`: Individual Pokémon with nickname, status, level
- `EncounterHistory`: Track what was caught in each area
- `DeathBox`: Collection of fainted Pokémon
- `GameProgress`: Current location, badges, etc.

## Validation Rules
- Ensure only one catch per area
- Prevent using fainted Pokémon in battles
- Require nicknames for all caught Pokémon
- Validate logical progression through areas
