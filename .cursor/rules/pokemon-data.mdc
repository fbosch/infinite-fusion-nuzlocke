## Data Handling
- Validate Pokémon data integrity
- Use proper error handling for data scraping
- Implement type-safe data structures
- Handle loading and error states gracefully

## PokéAPI Integration
- Use [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) as the primary data source for Pokémon information
- The API serves over 10 billion calls monthly and is free to use
- Base URL: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/`
- Key endpoints:
  - `/pokemon/{id or name}` - Individual Pokémon data
  - `/pokemon-species/{id or name}` - Species information
  - `/type/{id or name}` - Type data and effectiveness
  - `/ability/{id or name}` - Ability information
  - `/move/{id or name}` - Move data
- Handle API rate limiting gracefully
- Cache API responses to reduce load on the service
- Use proper error handling for network requests
- Implement fallback strategies for API failures
- Consider using the GraphQL endpoint for complex queries

## Specific Patterns for This Project
- Pokémon data should be type-safe and validated
- Handle fusion mechanics with proper TypeScript types
- Implement Nuzlocke rules with clear state management
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Keep data scraping scripts in `scripts/` directory
