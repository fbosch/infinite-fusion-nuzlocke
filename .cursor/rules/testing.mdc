# Testing Guidelines

Rules for testing strategy, file organization, and best practices.

## Testing Strategy

- Write unit tests with Vitest
- Test data integrity and utility functions thoroughly
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test File Organization

- Place test files alongside source files or in `tests/` directory
- Use `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions
- Follow the same directory structure as source files
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup and cleanup

## Testing Best Practices

- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external APIs and dependencies
- Use realistic test data
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
